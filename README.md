## Project: Sign-Up Form
From The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form).

This project is for practice of intermediate HTML and CSS. Click [here](https://kbousquet.github.io/sign-up-form) for the **Live version** of the webpage.
**The benefits I got from this project include:**
* More experience using CSS grid
* More experience using Flexbox
* Learned the basics of HTML forms and validation
